# hello-world
I will be uploading here pictures, images and ideas for future projects.

I am 28 years old and I'm still seeking what interests me the most. I was thinking about computers and technology and soon about programming and currently I am a _student in Baltic Institute of Technology (BIT)_. I am studying Java Script.
